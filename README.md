IMPORTANT!

You will need to retrieve an API key Canvas yourself, which should lie somewhere in your profile settings. You will also need the course number for the course you're trying to import from, which you can easily see in the URL on the home page for said Canvas course.

I should also warn that the CSS extracted from Canvas will be limited, in fact I haven't tested if the CSS URL's the code extracts from is exclusive to the specific course I tested this code on, so worst case scenario you may not get CSS at all.
